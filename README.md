This is Stadium - HTML.

This is a project for my portfolio in order to showcase my develpment skills in a tangible project. 

The current roadmap aims to:

  1. Capture high quality screenshots from Pokemon Stadium on the N64 using real hardware. 

  2. Recreate those images via HTML & CSS

  3. Use Javascript to add funcionality to the page, mimicking the game's functions.
  
  4. Populate the page's roster using a seperate database.

Future elements of the project may include adding more functionality to the page, recreating it in other frameworks such as Vue.js, or recreating the the page to fit aesthetically with more modern web design sensibilities. 

Skills I aim to show off in this project: 

  1. Translating a design faithfully into HTML.

  2. Adding responsive elements to an existing design.

  3. Development in a React environment.

  4. SQL
